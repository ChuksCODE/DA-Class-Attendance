## Project Overview
This DASHBOARD project helps SkilHarvest understand their students better. It helps the tech organization know the gender distribution, location, occupation, marital status of their Data Analytics students. This offers them more insight in understanding the level of activeness of the students via the response time and also the range of age distribution and gender that occupies the class, thus since by using this report they have identified these insights, they can further work on factors responsible for the low level of activeness towards studies.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
  EDA involved exploring the data to answer some questions such as:
  - What is the total number of students?
  - What is the most gender type in the DA Class?
  - What educational qualifications ranks most among the students?
  - What marital status appears the most among the students?
  - What occupation takes the lead in the class?
  - What is the highest age range in the class?
  - What geographical location or country produced more students in the class?

## Data Analysis
    
    This is where we included some basic lines of code or queries used during the analysis

    ```
    SQL

    SELECT *
    FROM TABLE 1
    WHERE A, B, C = Positive integers

    ```

## Results/Findings
  1. There were more males than females in the Data Analysis class
  2. The Data Analysis Class has more singles than the married
  3. The age range of 25-29 were more than other age ranges.
  4. There were more students based on occupational distribution than other occupations.
  5. There were more students from Nigeria than other African countries like Ghana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe
