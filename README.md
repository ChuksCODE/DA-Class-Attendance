## Recommendations
---
Here are some recommendations from the analysis

- Diversity and Inclusion Workshops: Given the mix of male and female interns, SkilHarvest can consider organizing workshops or sessions on diversity and inclusion. These can help foster a supportive and respectful environment for everyone especially women.

- Mentorship Programs: mentorship opportunities for interns can be created. Experienced professionals can guide them in their respective fields, helping them learn and grow into more complex fields in Data Science and Data Engineering

- Age-Appropriate activities based on age groups can be explored and created. For instance, the 25-29 age group can focus on skill development and career advancement. The 30-34 age group should be encouraged to network and collaborate while for those above the age of 35, opportunities for leadership roles and knowledge sharing should be provided.

Occupational growth: SkilHarvest can identify interns' career aspirations and align them with relevant projects or tasks. Also, offering job placements for outstanding students would go a long way in promoting SkilHarvest especially on the international job market.
